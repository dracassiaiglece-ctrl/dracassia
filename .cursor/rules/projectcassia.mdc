This project is a modern frontend application using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and a component-based architecture.

Project conventions:
- Organize code by feature and responsibility, not by file type.
- Components must be small, reusable and visually consistent.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid prop drilling when state can be localized or managed with Zustand.

Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling.
- Maintain spacing, hierarchy and visual breathing room.
- Prioritize clean, professional, premium layouts.
- Mobile-first approach is mandatory.

UI:
- Prefer shadcn/ui components when applicable.
- Animations must be subtle and meaningful (Framer Motion).
- Avoid visual clutter or unnecessary effects.

Code standards:
- Type everything properly.
- Avoid any.
- Keep components readable and predictable.
- Do not refactor unless there is a clear gain.

This project values professionalism, clarity, elegance and maintainability.
